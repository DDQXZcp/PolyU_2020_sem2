### The Japanese culture - Why go to Japan

The most important things are getting work experience. I know there is an experience gap 

Japanese is leading country of techology and industry in Apac. There are many lengendary company like Sony, Toshiba in electronic products. Mitsubishi in heavy industry. Toyota， Honda, Subaru, Isuzu in cars. I have also heard that there are a lot of advanced research conducted in Japan in the field of Automation, robotics, IT and it really attracts me. 

The Japanese has an attitude of focusing, team spirit


I have been to Austra(Saltsburg), Germany(Berney and Stuttgart), Australia(Sydney and Brisban), but I haven'y been to Japan yet. I would like to experience the culture there and get more working experience.
