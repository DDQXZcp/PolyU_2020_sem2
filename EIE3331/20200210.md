We can't avoid noise, noise may come from transistor thermo effect, xx effect(gap?) 

bandwidth increase -> frequency become higher? from low frequency wave to even visible light

Underwater, submarine, sona? 

optic fiber is very good, 5% reduction every xx kilometers?

The history of communication, the war fire -> telephone line(in Canada?)->

The signal are all analog before, now is digital thanks to high bandwidth

Different groups: IEEE

### The revision of linear system:

signal is a scalar value function of t

Fourier transform, Laplace transform

a system

Frequency analysis

The basic of fourier transform, periodic signal -> discrete spectrum

fourier transform

Convolution in time domain, multiplication in frequency domain

Multiply a cos function in time domain and shift phase in frequency domain

x(t)*cos(w0t) <-> 1/2[X(w+w0) + X(w-w0)], x(t)*sin(w0t) <-> j/2[X(w+w0) - X(w-w0)], Modulation theorem

We got system H(omega), y(t) = A0*|H(omega)|cos(t+angle(H(omega))

If periodic signal, period -> infinity,  spectrum will be more dense(because w0 = 2*pi/T0, fundamental frequency become smaller)

x(t) = 1/(2*pi)  / X(w)*e^jwt dw

X(w) = / x(t)*e^jwt dw , both from -inf to +inf

pulse <-> sinc function

linearity of CTFT

x(t-t0) = X(w)*e^(-jwt0), x(t)*e^(jw0t) = X(w-w0)

u(t) <-> 1/jw + pi* delta(w)
