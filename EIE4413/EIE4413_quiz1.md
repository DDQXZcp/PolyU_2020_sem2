A typical DSP system consists of 4 major components:

a. Transducer: To convert a signal to the change of voltage when receiving the signal. After processing, a transducer is ofter needed to convert the signal from the change of voltage back to its original form

b. Anti-aliasing filter: To avoid aliasing when sampling, an anti-aliasing filter is employed to limit the maximum frequency of the signal to be lowered than half of the sampling frequency.

c. A/D and D/A converters: The A/D converter will first sample the analog signal to its discrete time form and then quantized the signal to become a digital signal.
