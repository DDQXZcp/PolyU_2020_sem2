Review questions:

1. Flow control & Error Control

2. The data link layer needs to pack bits into frames. Framing divides a message into smaller entities to make flow and error control more manageable..

3. Flow control refers to a set of procedures that restricts the amount of data the sender can send before waiting for acknowledgement. It is to prevent buffer overflow. 

It is influenced by transmission time: Time taken to emit all bits into medium.

and Propagation time: Time for a bit to traverse the link.

Error control: Detection & Correction of error.

There are two kinds of error: Lost frame: a frame fails to arrived at the other side Damaged frame: frame arrives but some of the bits are in error.

4. Go-back-N ARQ is more efficient than stop-and-wait ARQ. Go-back-N ARQ uses pipelining and stop-and-wait ARQ does not. In stop-and-wait ARQ, we need to wait for acknowledgement for each frame before sending the next frame. In Go-back-N ARQ, we can send several frames before receiving acknowledgement.

5. In Go-back-N ARQ, if there is an error in a frame, the destination will discard that frame and all futre frames until frame in errors is received correctly. Transmitter must go back and  retransmit that frame and subsequent frames. 

In Selective-Repeat ARQ, destination will send negative acknowledgement indication the frame in error. Transmitter only retransmit the error frame. 

6. Piggybacking is to improve the efficiency of bidirectional transmission. When a frame is carrying data from A to B, it can also carry control information about frames from B. When a frame is carrying data from B to A, it can also carry control information about frames from A.

7. The packet from the network layer should be rejected.

8. Is a negative acknowledgement (REJ) necessary in the stop-and-wait ARQ protocol?

In fact, a negative acknowledgement(REJ) is not necessary at all, since the sender will automatically timeout if it fails to receive the ACK. The REJ improve the efficiency by informing the sender of a bad frame as early as possible.

## Question

1. sender sends a series of packets to the same destination using 5-bit sequence number. If the sequence
number starts with 0, what is the sequence number after sending 100 packets?

2^5=32, 101%32 = 5, the sequence number is 5-1 = 4

2. The timer of a system using the Stop-and â€“Wait ARQ protocol has a time-out of 6ms. Draw the flow
diagram for four frames if the round trip delay is 4ms. Assume no data frame or control frame is lost
or damaged.
