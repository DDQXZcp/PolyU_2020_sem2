Interleaving can't solve the problem entirely, but it will reduce the chances that the FEC codes fail

If we have burst error, Hamming codes and other FEC codes can only correct up to 1 or a few bit-errors. If we send the codewords separately, then one codeword may suffer many bit-errors and the FEC codes cannot correct. So interleaving is one way to reduce the impact of burst error to FEC codes
