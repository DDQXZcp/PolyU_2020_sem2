Key components of communication system: Source->transmitter->transmission system->receiver->destination

A network is the interconnection of a set of devices capable of communication

We classified the network through topology: mesh star bus ring

A protocol is a set of rules and format that governs the communication between communication peers.

OSI: Physical -> data link -> Network -> Transport -> Session -> Presentation -> Application

TCP/IP: Phtsical - > data link -> network -> transport -> application

Network support: Physical, data link, network layers

User support: Application layer(Application, presentation, session layers in OSI)

A peer-to-peer is created when two or more computers are connected and share information without going through a separate computer.
